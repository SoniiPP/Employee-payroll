# Employee-payroll
JavaScript Challenge 
WHEN I click the "Add employee" button
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary
WHEN I finish adding an employee
THEN I am prompted to continue or cancel
WHEN I choose to continue
THEN I am prompted to add a new employee
WHEN I choose to cancel
THEN my employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data

I got a help from tutor and AI asssitant .
